I'm working on essays about what I'm learning as I build this site and these projects:

- **Full-stack data science** — Why the best data scientists will be builders, not just analysts
- **Building with AI** — What actually works (and what doesn't) when shipping products with AI tools like Claude
- **The Build Loop** — Build → Ship → Grow → Analyze → Share → Repeat
- **Career reflections** — 15 years at the intersection of CS, data science, and business

Everything I write comes from doing, not theorizing. Real projects, real data, real lessons.

Follow along on [Substack](https://fullstackdatascientist.substack.com) or check the [GitHub](https://github.com/eeshansrivastava89/ds-apps-main) to see what I'm shipping.
