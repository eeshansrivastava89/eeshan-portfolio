				I'm Eeshan. I lead a data science team at Starbucks focused on AI/ML, personalization, and experimentation, including recommendation models powering the Starbucks app for 40M+ users.

			<p class='text-base text-muted-foreground'>
				12+ years across engineering, marketing analytics, modeling, and team leadership. CS undergrad, MBA. Not ex-FAANG. Not Ivy League. Just someone who likes making things work, learning by doing, and working with smart people.

			<p class='text-base text-muted-foreground'>
				I build data science apps on the side using AI tools. Each one teaches me something—about systems, about design & architecture, about data, about what real users actually do. Hard to push your team toward new approaches if you haven't struggled through the learning curve yourself.
