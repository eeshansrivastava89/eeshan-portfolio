			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				I studied computer science, built a career in data science, and picked up an MBA along the way. Fifteen years of learning how to make data useful — building models, leading teams, and sitting in rooms where decisions get made.
			</p>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				Currently at Starbucks, where I lead a data science team focused on customer behavior and experimentation. Most of my job is helping smart people do their best work — and translating what we learn into language executives can act on.
			</p>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				I build things on the side because I'm curious. It keeps me sharp, and honestly, it's hard to push your team toward new tools if you haven't felt the learning curve yourself.

				Building full-stack data science web apps from scratch. Each project is a learning lab where I'm the architect and AI handles the scaffolding.
