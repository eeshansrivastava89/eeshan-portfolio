# Launch Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Ship a polished site with visible proof, honest framing, and DRY patterns that scale to future projects.

---

## Principles

| # | Principle | Implication |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Data lives in YAML, logic in TS** | `projects.yaml` is source of truth for project metadata, stats config, AI story |
| 2 | **One component, multiple contexts** | `<ProjectCard>`, `<StatsCard>`, `<Timeline>` work on home, hub, stack, contribute |
| 3 | **Content links to projects** | Posts have `projectId` frontmatter; `getPostsByProject()` util queries them |
| 4 | **Patterns before pages** | Extract shared components first, then build pages that compose them |

---

## Phase 1: Shared Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

**Why:** Build reusable pieces before creating pages that use them.

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ✅ | `projects.yaml` with id, name, status, description, tags, stats config | Done |
| ✅ | `projects.ts` with `parseProjectsYaml`, `getProjectsByStatus`, `STATUS_CONFIG` | Done |
| ✅ | `<ProjectCard>` with stats hydration (full + compact variants) | Done |
| ✅ | Add `projectId` to post schema (`src/content/config.ts`) | Done |
| ✅ | Create `getPostsByProject(projectId)` util in `src/lib/posts.ts` | Done |
| ✅ | Add `aiStory` field to `projects.yaml` (array of bullets) | Done |
| ✅ | Extract `<Timeline>` to `packages/shared/src/components/Timeline.astro` | Done |
| ✅ | Create `<ConnectionStatus>` component | Done |

---

## Phase 2: Project Hub + Game Polish ✅ COMPLETE

**Why:** Hub is the shareable portfolio piece. Game stays focused on play with minimal chrome.

**Architecture:**
```
/projects (index)
├── Live projects (ProjectCard full variant)
├── What's Next (Timeline component)
└── Add to nav

/projects/ab-simulator (hub)
├── Hero + [Play Game →]
├── Stats (reuses StatsCard logic from ProjectCard)
├── AI Story (from projects.yaml.aiStory)
├── Related Content (getPostsByProject)
└── [Play Again →]

/ab-simulator (game)
├── <ConnectionStatus /> top bar
├── Nav: [← Back] [Project Docs]
└── Game UI (unchanged)
```

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ✅ | Create `/projects/index.astro` | ProjectCard (full) + Timeline, add to nav |
| ✅ | Create `/projects/ab-simulator.astro` hub page | Template for future hubs |
| ✅ | Hero with project name, description, [Play Game →] CTA | From `projects.yaml` |
| ✅ | Stats section using same Supabase fetch as ProjectCard | Done |
| ✅ | AI Story section rendering `projects.yaml.aiStory` bullets | Done |
| ✅ | Related Content section using `getPostsByProject('ab-simulator')` | Done |
| ✅ | Add `<ConnectionStatus>` to game page header | Green/red dots for PostHog/Supabase |
| ✅ | Add nav to game + "Project Docs" button | Done |

---

## Phase 3: Contribute + Content ✅ COMPLETE

**Why:** Honest framing for contribute. Analysis post proves DS chops and feeds hub.

**Key Decision:** Replace React-powered GitHub table with **static Markdown page**.

**Rationale:**
- Delete **3,834 lines** of code (fetch script, JSON data, 11 React components, types)
- Match existing doc pattern (like `docs/11_ACTIVE_...`)
- Manual updates force honest, current content
- GraphQL refactor (#21) stays open for future polish

**What Was Deleted:**
| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `scripts/fetch-build-log.mjs` | 397 |
| `src/data/build-log-data.json` | 2,387 |
| `src/components/contribute/*.tsx` (11 files) | 884 |
| `src/lib/build-log-config.ts` | 27 |
| `src/lib/build-log-types.ts` | 71 |
| `src/data/build-log/build-log-config.ts` | 68 |
| **Total deleted** | **3,834** |
| **New page created** | 230 |
| **Net reduction** | **-3,604** |

**New `/contribute` Structure:**
```markdown
# Build With Me
> Living document. Last updated: {date}

## 🎯 Current Focus
| Project | Status | Try It | Docs |

## 📋 Active Work  
| Phase | Description | Status | GitHub |

## 🔗 Quick Links
- All Open Issues
- Good First Issues
- Project Board

## 🚀 How to Contribute
4-step process + stack summary

## 👥 Contributors
Manual table

## 📰 Follow the Build
Substack, Twitter, RSS

## ❓ FAQ
```

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ✅ | Delete React components + fetch script | 3,834 lines deleted |
| ✅ | Create `/contribute` as Markdown-rendered page | 230 lines, clean Astro |
| ✅ | Structure: Focus, Active Work, Links, How-to, Contributors, FAQ | All sections present |
| ✅ | Add passive follow options | RSS, Substack, Twitter links |
| ☐ | Extend analysis notebook | Power, frequentist, Bayesian, CUPED |
| ☐ | Create analysis blog post | `projectId: ab-simulator`, `featured: true` |
| ☐ | Add 1-2 more launch anchor posts | "How I Built This", one essay |

---

## Phase 4: Stack + Documentation ✅ COMPLETE

**Why:** Architecture is non-obvious. Document it once for contributors and curious visitors.

**Site map:**
```
eeshans.com/
├── /                          # Home
├── /about                     # About
├── /projects/{id}             # Project hubs
├── /stack/                    # Architecture + workflows
├── /writing/{slug}            # Posts (with projectId)
└── /contribute/               # Follow the build
```

**Nav order:** About | Projects | Stack | Writing | Contribute

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ✅ | Create `/stack` page with architecture diagram | HTML/Tailwind boxes |
| ✅ | Document analytics flow | 6-step pipeline |
| ✅ | Document project bootstrap workflow | 8 steps |
| ✅ | Add shared `<Timeline>` component to stack | Reuses from home |
| ✅ | Writing workflow section | Frontmatter example |
| ✅ | Key file reference links | supabase-schema, cloudflare-proxy, projects.yaml |
| ✅ | Add `/stack` to nav | Order: About, Projects, Stack, Writing, Contribute |

---

## Phase 5: Engagement + Distribution (Backlog)

**Why:** Build social proof metrics for O-1 evidence. Consolidate content distribution.

### Content Architecture

```
eeshans.com (canonical home)
├── /writing/           ← ALL long-form lives here
├── /projects/          ← Proof of work with live stats
└── /contribute/        ← Follow along

Substack (distribution layer)
├── Purpose: Email list + syndication
├── Content: Full posts with canonical URL → eeshans.com
└── Simple nav: Home + About only

LinkedIn (amplification)
└── Teasers that drive to eeshans.com
```

**Rule:** Write once on eeshans.com, cross-post to Substack (set canonical URL), promote on LinkedIn linking to eeshans.com.

### Substack Cleanup

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ☐ | Remove multi-section nav | Kill "Stats & Experimentation", "Marketing & Media Measurement", etc. |
| ☐ | Keep simple nav | Just "Home" and "About" |
| ☐ | Update bio | "Full posts at eeshans.com" |
| ☐ | Cross-post with canonical URL | Substack Settings → Post → Set canonical URL |

### Giscus Comments

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ✅ | Enable GitHub Discussions on repo | Already enabled |
| ✅ | Configure Giscus | giscus.app → General category, pathname mapping |
| ✅ | Create `<Comments>` component | `src/components/Comments.astro` using giscus web component |
| ✅ | Add to all `/writing/*` posts | Added to `BlogPost.astro` layout |

**Issue:** [#92](https://github.com/eeshansrivastava89/ds-apps-main/issues/92) ✅ Closed

### Engagement Metrics (Supabase)

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ✅ | Set up PostHog batch export pipeline | Exports all events (incl. pageviews) to `posthog_batch_events` table |
| ✅ | Create `v_page_views` view | Aggregates pageviews by path from batch export |
| ✅ | Create `page_views()` RPC | Parameterized: `page_views('/projects/%', 30)` for any path pattern |
| ✅ | Rename `v_project_stats` → `v_ab_simulator_stats` | Clarified naming (puzzle-specific, not generic) |
| ✅ | Add indexes on `posthog_batch_events` | pathname, timestamp, event+timestamp |
| ✅ | Add "Like" button component | `LikeButton.astro` + `likes` table + `likes-webhook` edge function |
| ✅ | Add view count to ProjectCard | Fetches from `page_views()` RPC, matches `/{projectId}%` paths |
| ⏸️ | Create "Popular Posts" query | Backlog - Rank by `views + likes * 3` |

**Issue:** [#93](https://github.com/eeshansrivastava89/ds-apps-main/issues/93)

---

## Phase 6: Content + Launch (Backlog)

**Why:** Ship anchor content before announcing.

### 6.1 A/B Test Analysis Notebook

**Goal:** Publication-quality end-to-end A/B test analysis, rendered as HTML and embedded at `/projects/ab-simulator/analysis`

**Metrics Definition:**
- **Primary KPI:** `completion_time_seconds` (continuous) — B variant is harder, expect longer times
- **Secondary/Guardrail:** `completion_rate` (binary) — harder but still engaging
- **Engagement Guardrail:** `repeat_rate` (binary) — harder variant should still drive repeat behavior

**Notebook:** `analytics/notebooks/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`

| # | Section | Tasks | Outputs |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Setup & Data Pull** | Supabase connection, pull via RPCs, dataframe creation | Raw data loaded |
| 2 | **Exploratory Analysis** | Sample sizes, distributions, outliers, time trends | Histograms, box plots, daily volume chart |
| 3 | **Hypothesis & Metrics** | State H0/H1, define primary/secondary/guardrails | Markdown documentation |
| 4 | **Sanity Checks & QA** | SRM test (chi-square), data quality checks, segment balance | Pass/fail table |
| 5 | **Primary Analysis: T-Test** | Welch's t-test for completion time | p-value, CI, effect size (Cohen's d) |
| 6 | **Primary Analysis: Regression** | OLS with variant dummy, robust SEs | Coefficient table, R² |
| 7 | **Variance Reduction (CUPED)** | Mock setup for future experiment with pre-period covariate | Commented template code |
| 8 | **Secondary Metrics** | Completion rate (chi-square/proportion test), repeat rate | Effect sizes, CIs |
| 9 | **Results Visualization** | CI plots (forest plot style), daily A vs B trend | Publication-ready figures |
| 10 | **Post-Hoc Power Analysis** | Achieved power, MDE retrospective, sample size curves | Power analysis chart |
| 11 | **Conclusions** | Final decision, practical significance, limitations | Summary table |

**Build Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
```
Push to main (analytics/notebooks/*) → GH Action triggers →
Install Python + deps → papermill execute → nbconvert to HTML →
Commit HTML to public/analysis/ → Fly deploys with fresh HTML
```

**Future scale path:** When datasets grow, swap GH runner for Modal serverless.

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ✅ | Create `ab_test_analysis.ipynb` skeleton | All 11 sections as markdown + code cells |
| ✅ | Section 1-2: Setup + EDA | Data pull, distributions, KDE plots |
| ✅ | Section 3-4: Hypothesis + Sanity Checks | SRM test (⚠️ 33/67 split), QA checks |
| ✅ | Section 5-6: T-Test + Regression | Welch's t-test (p=0.42), OLS regression |
| ✅ | Section 7: CUPED template | Simulated demo (39% SE reduction) |
| ✅ | Section 8: Secondary metrics | Completion rate ⚠️-23%, Repeat rate ⚠️-15.5% |
| ✅ | Section 9: Visualizations | CI plot, daily trend chart |
| ✅ | Section 10: Post-hoc power | Power=12.8%, MDE=5.8s at n=49 |
| ✅ | Section 11: Conclusions | Recommend: Do NOT ship Variant B |
| ✅ | Build integration | GH Actions workflow with matrix build |
| ✅ | Create `/projects/ab-simulator/analysis` page | Dynamic Astro page with iframe embed |

### 6.2 Other Content

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ☐ | "How I Built the A/B Simulator" post | Technical deep-dive |
| ☐ | Launch announcement post | LinkedIn + Substack cross-post |

---

## Phase 7: Repo Architecture (Post-Launch)

**Why:** Separate repos = separate "original contributions" for O-1 evidence. Each project becomes a standalone, forkable artifact.

### Target Architecture

```
Repos:
├── eeshansrivastava89/build-log          ← Main site (eeshans.com)
├── eeshansrivastava89/ab-simulator       ← Standalone project
├── eeshansrivastava89/mmm-explorer       ← Future project
└── (optional) eeshansrivastava89/shared-ui ← npm package if needed

Hosting:
├── eeshans.com                  → build-log repo (Cloudflare Pages)
├── ab.eeshans.com               → ab-simulator repo (Cloudflare Pages)
└── eeshans.com/ab-simulator     → Cloudflare redirect to ab.eeshans.com
```

### Migration Steps

| ✓ | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| ☐ | Rename `ds-apps-main` → `build-log` | GitHub Settings → Rename |
| ☐ | Extract `packages/ab-simulator` to new repo | New repo `ab-simulator` |
| ☐ | Set up `ab.eeshans.com` subdomain | Cloudflare DNS + Pages |
| ☐ | Copy shared components to new repo | Timeline, ProjectCard (simple copy) |
| ☐ | Update main site links | Point to subdomain |
| ☐ | Add redirect rule | `/ab-simulator/*` → `ab.eeshans.com/*` |

### Benefits

| Metric | Monorepo | Separate Repos |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| GitHub stars | 1 repo | Multiple repos to star |
| Contributors | Shared | Per-project |
| "Original work" | "I built this site" | "I built ab-simulator, mmm-explorer, ..." |
| Forkability | Messy | Clean, focused |

### Shared Code Strategy

**Option 1: Copy-paste (recommended for now)**
- Small overlap (Timeline, ProjectCard)
- No npm publish/versioning overhead

**Option 2: npm package (if shared code grows)**
- Publish `@eeshan/shared-ui` to npm
- Both repos install as dependency
- More maintenance, only worth it for significant shared code

## DRY Inventory

| Pattern | Location | Used By |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Project metadata | `projects.yaml` | Home, hub, stack, contribute, ProjectCard |
| Status badges | `STATUS_CONFIG` in `projects.ts` | ProjectCard, Timeline, hub |
| Stats fetch | Inline in ProjectCard → extract to `fetchProjectStats()` | ProjectCard, hub, home |
| Post-project linking | `getPostsByProject()` | Hub, home featured |
| Timeline | Inline in index.astro → extract to `<Timeline>` | Home, stack |
| Connection status | New `<ConnectionStatus>` | Game, contribute |
| AI story | `projects.yaml.aiStory` | Hub |

---

## Execution Order

1. **Phase 1** (remaining): Schema + utils + component extraction
2. **Phase 2**: Hub page (consumes Phase 1 patterns), then game polish
3. **Phase 3**: Contribute reframe + analysis post (hub links to it)
4. **Phase 4**: Stack page documents what we built
